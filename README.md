# EasyEuler

**EasyEuler** is a set of python helper functions to apply 3D rotation, especially Euler Angles, based on _scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation_.
You can learn, understand and test Rotation quickly, and use these functions in your codes easily.

It includes:
- **RotEx**, the core of EasyEuler, as an extension of _scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation_. It provides basic algrithm from mathematics perspective.
- **attitude, rotate_vectors** ..., providing some functions for all kinds of applications of rotation from application perspective.
- **tests**, pytest functions for the above.

**Make Euler Angles easy, not dizzy!**

# Prerequisites

- numpy
- scipy
- pytest

# Get started

Run test.py in the root. It calls tests on all functions provided in EasyEuler folder.
